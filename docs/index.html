    <p>To all our 100 Mile Markets customers,</p>

    <p>Thank you! Thank you for supporting our mission to celebrate and strengthen local food systems. This journey has been rewarding, inspiring and at times, challenging.</p>

    <p>We've recently made the difficult decision to shut down 100 Mile Markets. But, the incredible news is that Marilyn and Bob at Harbor Harvest didn't want you to lose access to the local products you love. They have decided to take over running a digital farmers market that will operate in much the same way. The market will still be open for online orders every Monday with an in-store pickup option on Thursdays.</p>

    <p>What does this mean for you?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>100 Mile Markets will run for one more week and then Harbor Harvest will take over.</li>
      <li>We'll send you to a different website after next week.</li>
      <li>You'll be moved over to a new Harbor Harvest email list and receive your market alerts from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I (Elise) will be staying on to help out with this new version of the market. I'll send out more information once the new site is up and running. Please let me know if you have any questions about this change by simply responding to this email. And if you do not want to be part of the new email list, you can unsubscribe from this one anytime in the next week.</p>

    <p>Thank you all so much,</p>
    <p>Elise, Rita, Steve, and Matt</p>
