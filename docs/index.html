    <p>To all our 100 Mile Markets customers,</p>

    <p>Thank you! Thank you for supporting our mission to celebrate and strengthen local food systems. This journey has
      been rewarding, inspiring and at times, challenging.</p>

    <p>We've recently made the difficult decision to shut down 100 Mile Markets. But, the incredible news is that
      Marilyn
      and Bob at Harbor Harvest didn't want you to lose access to the local products you love. They have decided to take
      over running a digital farmers market that will operate in much the same way. The market will still be open for
      online orders every Monday with an in-store pickup option on Thursdays.</p>
